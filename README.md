Musa Dawodu is a 19 years old Nigerian male who lives with his parents in Lekki, Lagos State. Recently, he wrote the JAMB exam and had the following scores in his combination:
ENG - 70

Using the factory method, implement a createPerson() factory function that takes name, age and location as arguments. Afterwards, create an object representing Musa from the factory function. 
Also, implement a factory function createJambScores() that takes eng, govt, lit, crk as arguments. Then create an object representing Muse’s JAMB scores. Add the object as a property to Musa object you created above in (a) above

As Nigeria goes to the polls, here is an object representing some of the Presidential Candidates:

const presidentialCandidates = {
   AAC: 'Omoyele Sowore',
   ACCORD: 'Christopher Imumolen',
   APC: 'Bola Ahmed Tinubu',

   NNPP: 'Rabiu Kwankwaso',
   PDP: 'Atiku Abubakar',
}
